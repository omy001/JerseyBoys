This is a program built on a neural network structure that predicts realtime emotion of a person based on their facial expressions!
The parameter weights of the model in file 'model.h5' are optimum values calculated by training the model.
With the weights in model.h5, the accuracy of the program remains constant at around 60%.

The purpose of this program is to help psychiatrists understand their patient's condition better.
The psychiatrist records the facial expressions of their patient with the program to output a file that has the emotion predictions.
4.5 emotion predictions are made every second. After the session is over, the psychiatrist can use the large amount of data recorded to calculate important information like their patient's happiness quotient.

The happiness quotient is a concept created by us where it is calculated by finding what percentage of the emotions the patient experiences is happiness. This helps the psychiatrist to understand whether his/her patient is improving after each session compared to the last.
